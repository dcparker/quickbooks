== Welcome to QuickBooks for Ruby

QuickBooks is a module that allows you to connect to QuickBooks and QuickBooks Merchant
Services via the QuickBooks SDK (QBXML).  You need to configure the QuickBooks Remote Data 
Sharing Server (RDS) in order to connect.  The RDS server allows you to use the SDK over
https webservice.  This means that you can communicate with QuickBooks from non-Windows 
operating systems.

== Download

* http://rubyforge.org/projects/quickbooks
* svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/quickbooks/trunk

== Status

This library is a work in progress and has very limited capabilities right now.  There is
a Connection class that will let you connect to QuickBooks and send QBXML directly.  I am in 
the process of implementing all the messages that you can send and recieve in an easy to 
use class structure.

== Usage

You can use the QuickBooks::Connection class to talk to the RDS server:

      connection = QuickBooks::Connection.new('admin', 'pass123', 'My Test App')
      connection.open
      xml = <<EOL
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<?qbxml version="3.0"?>
	<QBXML>
	  <QBXMLMsgsRq onError="continueOnError">
	    <InvoiceQueryRq requestID="1">
	      <RefNumber>81</RefNumber>
	      <IncludeLineItems>true</IncludeLineItems>
	    </InvoiceQueryRq>
	  </QBXMLMsgsRq>
	</QBXML>
	EOL
      connection.send(xml)
      connection.close

== Changes

I renamed QuickBooks::Session to QuickBooks::Connection as it seems more intuitive.
